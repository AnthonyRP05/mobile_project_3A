This is a simple application, displaying all the cryptocurrencies sorted by rank. You can select one and see is description which include current price, high & low within last 24h and a small description.

### <b><i>TODO</i></b>
 - Add cache (I tried two methods, the one seen in TD that doesn't crash my application, and a method using ROOM but this one crashed my app at launch, due to lack of time I didn't have time to study it for a long time and I preferred to make a project without cache, but better coded)
 - Add a conversion option
 - Finger swipe navigation
 - create a Widget
 - Make it watch friendly
 - and more

If you have any advice about my code and what I should do to make it more effective for my TODO list, please let me know. 
If you've enjoyed this project as much as I enjoyed doing it, please put a ‚≠ê
