# mobile_project_3A

Develop with Android Studio 4.2.1 Test with android 11 R, SDK 31

This is a simple application, displaying all the cryptocurrencies sorted by rank. You can select one and see is description which include current price, high & low within last 24h and a small description. I used the CoinMarketCap api for this application which requires an API Key.

The first list uses a RecyclerView and follow the MVVM architecture as Google recommend. The detail uses a simple text and image view with a "previous" button who guide us to the list of all cryptocurrencies

## TODO
 - Add cache (I tried two methods, the one seen in TD that doesn't crash my application, and a method using ROOM but this one crashed my app at launch, due to lack of time I didn't have time to study it for a long time and I preferred to make a project without cache, but better coded)
 - Add a conversion option
 - Finger swipe navigation
 - create a Widget
 - Make it watch friendly
 - and more
